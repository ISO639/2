# ISO 639-2 language codes

This project was built out of the need to have a full set of all different ISO 639-2 language codes as well as the English and the native Full Name.

## About the ISO 639-X

There're two subset of this ISO Norm.

 * ISO 639-1 (Alpha-2 code/1988)
 * ISO 639-2 (Alpha-3 code/1998)

> Every language code present in the two-letter code set has a corresponding language code in the alpha-3 list, but not necessarily vice versa.
> ISO 639-2:1998 provides two sets of three-letter alphabetic codes for the representation of names of languages, one for terminology applications and the other for bibliographic applications.
> The code sets are the same except for twenty-five languages that have variant language codes because of the criteria used for formulating them.

> The language codes were devised originally for use by libraries, information services, and publishers to indicate language in the exchange of information, especially in computerized systems.
